# Practice projects for Android programming

## Branch `Practice_1`
Implement the 2 listeners for buttons 'clear' and 'pay'
 - One burger is $5
 - Result should contain 5 multiplied by number chosen
 - Display should be prefixed with the '$' sign such as $15
 - Reset should clear all the fields

## Branch `Practice_2`
It contains buttons for sending implicit intents:
- Open a URL in a browser.
- Find a location on a map.
- Share a text string.
- View the Contacts
- Dial a number

## Branch `Practice_3`
This project is an adaptation from Google Sample Code. It includes:
- Buttons for changing the background Color. (This is done)
- Buttons to count up and reset the Counter => TODO
- Save and Restaure Prefs button to store and retrieve current color and Counter => TODO

Each branch has a MainActivity.java file where the work to do is identified by a `TODO`. 
This is the only file to change. Everything else is done for you.
